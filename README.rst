mu4e-query-fragments.el: mu4e support for query fragments
=========================================================

``mu4e-query-fragments`` allows to define query snippets ("fragments") that can
be used in regular mu4e_ searches or bookmarks. Fragments can be used to define
complex filters to apply in existing searches, or supplant bookmarks entirely.
Fragments compose properly with regular mu4e/xapian operators, and can be
arbitrarily nested.

This package is fully documented in the source and maintained through MELPA:
